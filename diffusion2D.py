Solve (u_xx + u_yy)*nu_u = u_t on a uniform grid
and (v_xx + v_yy)*nu_v = v_t on a uniform grid

with exact solution 
u, v = exp(-nu*pi^2*(a^2+b^2)t)*sin(a*pi*x)*sin(b*pi*y)

for initial condition
u, v = sin(a*pi*x)*sin(b*pi*y)

for integer choices a and b
this allows for a lot of flexibility 
in how things want to be defined

lets pick 
u_a = 1, u_b = 1, nu_u = 1
v_a = 4, v_b = 2, nu_v = 0.5
tf = 1, the final time

These are independent of eachother, but are sufficient to check the
unsteady solver is working

The discretization is the same as in poisson2D, with an additional
du/dt = R(U), handled by odeint.

the main difference is that the time of a block (.t) is used in the 
boundary blocks, which are defined by a single source returning a dictionary

boundary block state = S(boundary block)

This is very much a work in progress and not actively used, but it could be...

The code does a rough accuracy estimation,
and outputs the accuracy for both u and v. The accuracy should be around 2 if 
the code is performing correctly.
