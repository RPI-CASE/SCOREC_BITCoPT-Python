Solve u_xx + u_yy = f(x,y) on a uniform grid
  and v_xx + v_yy = f(x,y) on a uniform grid

with known solution

u = exp(xy)         f['u'] = (x^2+y^2)*exp(xy)
v = exp((x^2+y^2))  f['v'] = (4*(x^2+y^2+1))*exp((x^2+y^2)) 

This is discretized using fluxes, for example, denoting u^{i,j} as the cell
centered at (x^{i,j},y^{i,j})

u^{i+1/2,j}_x = u^{i+1,j}-u^{i,j})/(Delta x)

for u^{i+1/2,j} the midpoint on an edge of the grid

We can form fluxes across the four edges of a cell to
sum their contributions to u^{i,j}, since
u^{i,j}_xx = u^{i+1/2,j}_x-u^{i-1/2,j}_x)/(Delta x)
And put it all together to get

u^{i+1/2,j}_x-u^{i-1/2,j}_x)/(Delta x)+ u^{i,j+1/2}_y-u^{i,j-1/2}_y)/(Delta y) - (x^{i,j}^2+y^{i,j}^2)*exp(x^{i,j}y^{i,j})

Our flux functions are then a simple difference, 
where P is a dictionary of parameters, in this case, with P['d'] = Delta x (or Delta y),
the grid spacing. Both 'u' and 'v' have similar forms, and so the same function is used

def difference(B,N,P):
  return dict((s,(N[s]-B[s])/P['d']) for s in B.state)


The code does a rough accuracy estimation,
and outputs the accuracy for both u and v. The accuracy should be around 2 if 
the code is performing correctly.
